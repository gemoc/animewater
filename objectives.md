ANIME-WATER addresses the challenge to formulate new water management and sharing rules under uncertainties allowing for anticipation of future climate changes and taking into account human-non human interactions. This endeavor involves the creation of territorial digital twins, designed to bolster territorial foresight and water governance. These digital twins function as mediation tools, tailored to local expectations and enriched by a suite of generic hydrological models. Such an approach aims to foster dialogue and operate translations between hydrological modelers and stakeholders, facilitating constructive dialogues enriched with objective information and clarified uncertainties, ultimately supporting territorial planning. The project capitalizes on existing interdisciplinary projects established across diverse regions (including Rennes, Lorient, and the Normandy shoreline), each co-designed with a variety of local stakeholders. ANIME-WATER will craft a prototype for deploying digital twins, underpinned by two interconnected Ph.D. projects in computer science (and hydrology) and sociology (and hydrology). In order to ensure comprehensive governance, we propose the establishment of a governing body within the framework of the Water and Territories Chair at the University of Rennes Foundation.
